Day 13 : week 3
In this module, we practiced several hands-on tasks that combine Python basics, networking concepts, and automation techniques. We began by creating functions to compute network latency, where reusable functions calculated the minimum, maximum, and average values from a list of sample latency measurements. This helped us understand how functions make code modular and easier to maintain.

Next, we developed a menu-driven CLI tool using loops and conditional logic. The program displayed options to the user, accepted input, and executed tasks such as running an IP reachability test or calculating latency statistics. The while loop kept the menu running until the user selected the exit option, demonstrating interactive command-line automation.

We also implemented IP address testing, where a loop repeatedly used the system ping command to check whether a host was reachable. 

Additionally, we learned about cron jobs and task scheduling, which automate scripts at specific intervals in Linux. Finally, we covered essential Python basics including variables, loops, functions, and modules—skills used throughout all hands-on exercises.







Day 14 ,week 3:- Today we learnt about Errors in python, in that Types of Error, how to control errors, difference between Errors and exceptions,  exception handling, python try except blocks , python try-except-finally block.
Next we learnt about logging modules, in that logging basics, logging levels, implementing logging, changing log format, logging to a file , advanced python logging and examples using logger objects.
hands on lab on API logging topics and decorator to auto-log function.
Also did hands-on on 2 tasks related to Cron job ssh
